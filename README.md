#The Impact of a Global Pandemic on the Seven Major Currencies
##Mala Sharma, Orlando Fuller, Omar Goodwin


## Proposal / Hypothesis<br> We have studied patterns in the foreign exchange market during the initial year of the COVID19 pandemic. We have noticed correlations between certain currency pairs within our subset of currency exchange data. We have also focused on periods of peak COVID19 case numbers and death counts to examine any trends reflected in the global currency exchange market in congruence with the global pandemic.

### Question 1<br>How much does the global market economy of the foreign currency exchange market mirror the societal and economic upheaval caused by a global pandemic?

### Findings <br>

)<br>
### Question 2<br>What are the seven major currency pairs? 

### Findings <br>The seven major currency pairs are the audusd, eurusd, nzdusd, gbpusd, usdcad, usdchf, and usdjpy.

### Question 3<br>How did the seven major currencies move over the course of the initial year of the pandemic? 

### Findings <br>It has been interesting to see indications of how certain currency pairs show a decline whereas others such as New Zealand and Australia appear to have positive correlation.

### The graph seen above shows the overall decline in the USDCHF currency pair over the course of 2020.

### The graph shown above demonstrates a sharp increase in market value of USDCAD at the onset of the reality of the pandemic in March 2020, followed by a drastic decline in value over the remainder of the year

![Interestingly, the EURUSD currency pair follows a slightly more volatile trajectory in relation to Brexit during the pandemic. At the moment of fruition of Brexit, the Euro value in USD terms saw a brief uptick followed by a ninety degree drop due to the beginning of the pandemic and the rise of COVID19 case numbers. However after the initial drop in value, the EURUSD continued to rise in value for the remainder of the year in tandem with the British Pound in USD terms.](https://github.com/OrlandoFuller/Project_1/blob/main/images/EURUSD-PX.png)<br>

### The AUDUSD endured the sudden drop in market value in the early days of the pandemic, as the value of the currency pair followed a steady incline for the rest of the year in concert with the Euro, the Pound, and the New Zealand Dollar.
### Question 4<br> Did countries hit hardest by COVID19 experience major fluctuations in currency market value?

### Findings <br> The currency pairs that are most representative of the countries that were hit hardest by COVID19 such as the Italian Euro and the British Pound do not reflect a downturn in market value due to the societal-economic impact of the pandemic. Instead the value of those currencies in the past year indicated a resilience and increase in value.

### Question 5<br>Do we notice any market trends during peaks in COVID19 case counts and death counts?


### Findings <br> Due to the brevity of data when looking at one year's worth of market value changes, it has been difficult to compare the global currency exchange market to corresponding dates where COVID19 case numbers and rates of death saw sharp increases globally. If we had more time to parse more COVID19 data we would have wanted to compare specific dates relative to spikes in COVID19 case numbers & death counts in specific countries and compare those changes to the volatility, if any, of corresponding currency exchange pairs of those countries undergoing the most COVID19 induced duress.

### Question 6<br>What impact has COVID19 had on the foreign exchange market in terms of the currencies we studied?


### Findings <br>By looking at each currency pair's fluctuations over the course of this past year of the pandemic we have been able to notice certain trends especially around the timeline of the onset of the spread of COVID19 across the globe. Initially, our group anticipated that all the currency pairs would show an overall decline in value across the course of the year. However, the data surprised us by indicating instead, in some cases such as New Zealand & Australia a consistent uptick in market value. One could suggest that those positive upticks came as a result of New Zealand in particular taking rapid control of the spread of the virus within their own borders and thus a faster post-pandemic economic recovery as New Zealand's population returned to something closer to "normalcy" of daily life social engagements. The data suggests conversely, that even nations undergoing severe pandemic circumstances due to a not-so-rapid government response to the real-ness and immediate gravity of the pandemic, such as the UK, still saw a positive change in the value of the British pound in USD terms.

### Question 7<br>Which currency pairs have increased in value during the covid-19 pandemic?


### Findings <br>Some currency pairs such as the GBPUSD, EURUSD, AUDUSD, and NZDUSD increased in value for a majority of the past year past the initial onset of pandemic-related economic conditions.

### Question 8<br>Which currency pairs have decreased in value during the covid-19 pandemic?

### Findings <br>Certain currency pairs such as the USDCAD and the USDJPY have shown indications of the most negative consequences in market value as a result of the pandemic.
